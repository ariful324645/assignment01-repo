              Professor Muhammad Yunus established the Grameen Bank in
              Bangladesh in 1983, fueled by the belief that credit is a
              fundamental human right. His objective was to help poor people
              escape from poverty by providing loans on terms suitable to them
              and by teaching them a few sound financial principles so they
              could help themselves From Dr. Yunus’ personal loan of small
              amounts of money to destitute basketweavers in Bangladesh in the
              mid-70s, the Grameen Bank has advanced to the forefront of a
              burgeoning world movement toward eradicating poverty through
              microlending. Replicas of the Grameen Bank model operate in more
              than 100 countries worldwide.
